    <h2>Ingridients And Instructions</h2>
    <h3>For the Fries</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>4 large russet potatoes</li>
            <li>1-2 ltrs of vegetable oil</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>Optional seasonings: garlic powder, paprika, black pepper, or any favorite seasoning blend</li>
        </ol>
    </p> 
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the potatoes</li>
               <p>wash and peel the potatoes</p>
               <p>cut the potatoes into uniform sticks about 1/4 inch thick.
                  Try to keep them as even as possible to ensure they cook evenly.</p>
            <li>Soak the potatoes</li>
               <p>Place the cut potatoes in a large bowl of cold water. Soak for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight in the refrigerator. 
                This helps to remove excess starch and keeps the fries from sticking together.</p>
            <li>Heat the oil</li>
               <p>In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or deep fryer, heat the vegetable oil to 325째F (165째C). 
                Use a thermometer to ensure the temperature is accurate.</p> 
            <li>First Fry (Blanching)</li>
                <p>Drain the potatoes and pat them dry with paper towels.</p>
                <p>Working in batches, fry the potatoes in the hot oil for about 3-4 minutes. 
                   They should be softened but not browned. Remove them with a slotted spoon and place on a baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain.</p>
                <p>Allow the fries to cool for at least 30 minutes. You can also refrigerate them for up to an hour.</p>
            <li>Second Fry (Crisping)</li>
                <p>Increase the oil temperature to 375째F (190째C).</p>
                 <p>Again working in batches, fry the blanched potatoes for a second time for about 2-3 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy.</p>
                 <p>Remove the fries with a slotted spoon and place on a baking sheet lined with fresh paper towels to drain. Immediately season with salt and any other desired seasonings.</p>
        </ol>
