        <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>

    <h3><em>Baking the Lasagna</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, ensuring it does not touch the cheese
             (you can use toothpicks to keep the foil off the cheese if necessary).</li>

        <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly

        <ul>
            <li>Allow the lasagna to rest for 15 minutes before serving.
